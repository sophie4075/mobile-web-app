# List and Tile View Interface

This project replicates and extends a list view interface inspired by the SoundCloud app for Android, incorporating both list and tile display modes with dynamic content loading and interactivity. 
This interface was designed to closely match the template in terms of colors and proportions, while also supporting features for user interaction and dynamic data handling from a JSON source.
