This is the first part of an assignment we had at university.
We had to design an HTML document structure for the list view shown on the left and create CSS rules to implement the visual interface. This view is inspired by the list view from the SoundCloud app for Android shown on the right. It was sufficient if the appearance closely matched the template on the left in terms of colors and proportions of elements, as the template itself was developed based on the SoundCloud list view's appearance

We then proceeded to adapt this list view into a tile view without altering the underlying HTML structure. The same DOM elements were used for both views, with differentiation achieved by simply assigning a suitable class to the root element. Additionally, we integrated a feature using the 'Tile'/'List' control to allow users to switch seamlessly between the two views. Further development included handling user interactions within the list view, which required dynamically building the interface based on a server-provided JSON array of objects. This dynamic construction also allowed for modifications through existing controls without altering the JSON structure, thus maintaining the integrity of the data while enhancing user engagement and interactivity.
